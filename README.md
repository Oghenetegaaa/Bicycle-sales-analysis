## Data Cleaning

- Create a duplicate of the dateset in other to still have the original dataset
- Removed duplicates from the dataset
- Standardized the column
- Created a column to show the age bracket this was done with the use of IF statements

## Pivot Tables

  - Pivot table; Rows:Gender, Values:Average of Income, Columns:Purchased Bike.

## Slicers
To filter the dashboard based of different conditions
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education

## Key insights
1. Average income per purchase
   - Men earn higher incomes that women on average.The data suggests that men are more likely to purchase bicycle as their income increases, whereas women's purchasing behaviour is less correlated with incomme.
   - Recommendations; Focus marketing efforts on high-income men, as they are more likely to make purchase and also providing premium bicycles as a status symbol,appealing to men's desire for luxury.

2. Age brackets per purcahase
   - Middle age brackets earn the most and make the most purchases hence, they are the target audience.The old age income, older individuals with higher incomes make fewer purchases than those with lower incomes who makes more purchases. Same thing goes for the young age brackets.
   - Recommendations; Since the middle age is the target audience the market shoule be focused towards products that suit this age brackets as they arer most likely to make more purchases. Also the needs of older and younger age brackets should be considered so they would not be left out and to maximize sales in all areas.

3. Income per commuter distance
   - Purchases increased for commute distance less than 10 miles. While for longer distances the purchase was lower.
   - Recommendations; Since the customers with shorter distances buy more bicycle, the avalability of bicycle that suits their commute distance should be ensured in larger quantities. Also, bicycles for customers who commute longer distances should also be made available (like electric bicycle)  in minimal quantities to meet the demands of this particular customers. This creates an equilibrum whilst also maximazing sales.
